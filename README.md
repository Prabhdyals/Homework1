The firm competes in the space of point of sale and eCommerce solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. In the ecommerce industry many competitors have emerged as one-stop-shop for tools that enable a business to go online (shopify, amazon, Hubspot and square). In contrast, the company focuses on international operations, providing tools for entry-level entrepreneurs and brick-mortar merchants..

As one could see that most of the prices are very similar and price competition is high, but due to Fin Tech being a growing industry most companies have growing revenues. 
The industry came into existence in the late 1980s with firms such as POSIM, LS Retail and DdD.The industry of POS software( Hospitality Fintec) has started to quickly grow around the early 2000s with firms such as Lightspeed, ShopKeep and Censornet ;the industry entered the growth stage. The growth levels started to stagnate around the mid 2010s, which is when the industry entered the shakeout stage in its Life Cycle, where it currently stands. The growth of the industry is definitely slowing down; the competition is intense and consistent, as most players have been in the business for a number of years and a large portion of the market is held by a relatively small number of players; and as observed in the firms that are public, the profitability is decreasing.(Owler.com, 2019)

Furthermore, it has to be said again that the company had an IPO on March 15th, 2019 and still wants to adjust to the market conditions. Lightspeed is trying to increase its growth through financing with debt, which is understandable to attract more clients and maximize their perspectives for future expansion. The Fin tech  Industry is considered highly competitive which possesses certain threats for the company while Lightspeed does not show a perfect foundation for the decision to invest in the short term, but has a potential to become an industry leader in the long-term and financial statements of the company are showing growth during recent years.
